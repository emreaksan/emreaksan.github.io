I am a Research Scientist in the AR Perception group at Google.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction, with a primary focus on the perception and synthesis of human activities, aiming to digitize humans in various aspects. Technically, I am interested in deriving new machine learning algorithms, particularly generative temporal models to capture human dynamics and generate human-like interactions. 

Prior to joining Google, I was a PhD student in the [Advanced Interactive Technologies](https://ait.ethz.ch/) lab at ETH Zurich, advised by [Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges/). The focus of my thesis was deep generative temporal modeling with applications in the tasks of 3D motion modeling and prediction, building 3D face avatars, and modeling and synthesis of free-form human actions such as digital representations of drawings and handwritten text. 
<!-- I hold a MSc and a BSc in Computer Engineering from METU, Turkey. -->
